      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p><span class="callout">Lakeland Reeds</span> is an ideal place to unplug from your daily routine, whether on the shore of Twin Lakes watching the sunset over the cattails, or just curled up in a hammock on our wraparound porch with a good book.  Breakfast is ready whenever you are, and we're happy to accommodate a wide range of appetites, from comfort food, like sausage and biscuits, to the lighter end of things, such as egg white omelettes and fresh fruit.</p>
      <p>We're here to help you get the most out of your time with us, from canoes and life vests for a day out on the lake, to popcorn and a DVD of <span id="title">The Wizard of Oz</span> for a quiet evening in. We look forward to welcoming you!</p>
